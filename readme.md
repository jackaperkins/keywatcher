## Keywatcher
__A local node app to watch your hands and alert you!__
- Assume you have a keylogger file at /var/log/keystroke.log
- Log it all to a local sqlite db
- Give a nice local webpage showing a graph and some colored boxes
- Give osx system/growl alerts when you've reached the 5 minute threshold
